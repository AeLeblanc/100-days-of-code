### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017
** Today's progress:Forked my dev portfolio on codepen to focus on creating a more functional contact form.
** Thoughts: When I get stuck, doing research and finding a solution or a better way is extremely rewarding. Thats why I am so passionate about coding! There's always another option and always more to learn. Even though I was struggling with my initial idea for the contact form, I haven't given up. Forking is great! I will have to go back to the original concept later once I have learned more.
